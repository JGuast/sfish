Shell Project:

This project mimics the behavior of GNU's BASH shell.
It allows users to run both builtin and programmer
defined executables and suppots the use of the pipe(|),
and arrows (< and >) for redirecting input/output 
between processes. Also supports sending processes 
to the background and bringing them back to the 
foreground. Users can also kill off processes.
